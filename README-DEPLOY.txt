Agent-Ops™ (Option A: Outcomes-only public site)

What changed:
- Public page is outcomes-only (no live playbook, no tool details).
- Interactive assets, templates, dashboards, and runbooks are delivered via the MBCC Client Vault after engagement or deposit.
- Pitch deck download is replaced by a gated notice PDF (no IP leak).

Deploy:
- Upload all files to your agentops GitHub Pages repo root and commit.
- Hard refresh after Pages rebuild.
